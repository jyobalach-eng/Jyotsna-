Terraform : 
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage cloud infrastructure. 
Developed by HashiCorp, it allows you to define and manage your infrastructure resources (like virtual machines, networks, and databases) in configuration files. 
Terraform then uses these files to create, update, and delete resources across various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premise environments.
Terraform Workflow: 
The typical workflow involves three main steps:
Write: You define your infrastructure in .tf files using HCL.
Plan: You run terraform plan to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure before it actually applies them. This gives you a chance to review and confirm the planned actions.
Apply: You run terraform apply to execute the changes defined in the plan and provision the resources.
